## this project is a Re-Uploead & Fork of the original project(taken down)

This repository contains the source code for **Layuh**, a C++ project designed to interact with the Roblox environment. It focuses on implementing advanced functionalities, including in-game enhancements and tools for client interaction.

## Features

* **Aimbot:** Module for in-game aiming assistance.
* **ESP (Extra Sensory Perception):** Functionality that provides augmented visual information about the game environment and players (e.g., seeing through walls).
* **User Interface (GUI):** Implementation of an interactive graphical user interface for controlling features, built with ImGui and rendered via DirectX.
* **Authentication/Licensing System:** Integration with KeyAuth for managing software access.
* **Network Communication:** Uses the cURL library for HTTP requests.
* **JSON Data Handling:** Utilizes the nlohmann/json library for data serialization and deserialization.
* **Obfuscation and Protection:** Incorporates modules like Oxorany to hinder reverse engineering and code analysis.
* **Kernel/System-Level Interaction:** Contains modules suggesting low-level interactions with the operating system or the Roblox client.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

* **`Layuh/`**: Main project directory.
    * `entry.cpp`, `entry.h`: Main entry point and initialization logic.
    * `kernel/`: Modules related to kernel/driver-level interaction (`driver.cpp`, `driver.h`).
* **`Layuh/cheat/`**: Contains the core logic for the functionalities.
    * `aimbot/`: Source files for the Aimbot module.
    * `esp/`: Source files for the ESP module.
    * `globals/`: Global definitions and Roblox-specific headers (`roblox.h`).
    * `images/`: Image handlers.
    * `menu/`: Modules for the user interface.
        * `ui/imgui/`: ImGui library and its adapters for DirectX and Win32.
        * `ui/render/`: Rendering and overlay drawing logic.
    * `misc/`: Miscellaneous functions and utilities.
    * `utils/`: General utility functions.
* **`Layuh/cheat/include/`**: Third-party libraries and dependencies.
    * `curl/`: cURL library for HTTP requests.
    * `keyauth/`: KeyAuth library files for authentication.
    * `nlohmann/`: JSON handling library.
    * `oxorany/`: Files related to code obfuscation.
    * `zlib/`: Data compression library.
